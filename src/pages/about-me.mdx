# About Me

My name is Ian Jones. I am a web developer from the Pacific North West but currently live in Northern Virginia. I love geeking out on note taking systems and programming computers.

I work primarily in Ruby and JavaScript but love functional programming languages. I'm currently learning Clojure/ClojureScript.

One of my hobbies is working on my personal knowledge management system. I publish my work in progress notes to my [digital garden](https://garden.ianjones.us). Go take a look!
