Most UI tests should center around integration testing. [Cypress](/cypress) is really good at end to end and integration testing so it makes a great tool for this.

Here's the canonical tweet:

Integration testing largely tests at the HTTP level. So you would test `GET /` instead of a component like `import Index from '.'` Testing in the browser also allows you to avoid mocking out unsupported browser features in a node environment. <SideNote idName="2">I have often found this to be the most annoying part of jest tests</SideNote>

Integration tests with [Cypress](/cypress) allow me to test workflows in UI's without messing around with low level details.

Often I really just want to mock data from HTTP requests and see how the interface responds to those cases.
