First things first, I am new to emacs and the eco system so there are packages I&rsquo;m not aware of.
This is my current set up that I am pretty happy with but if you read through it and see something that can be improved, please let me know on twitter at `@_jonesian` or on the Doom Emacs Discord server!

## Installing Doom Emacs

These are instructions for Mac/Linux, if you're on windows I recommend looking at [ervingad's window instructions here](https://github.com/earvingad/configfiles/blob/master/emacs/DoomEmacsWindows.org).

First things first, you need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). I try to install as many programs from homebrew as I can. This way I can reduce the overhead of keeping all my dependencies up to date.

Once homebrew is installed, there are a couple utils you need for doom emacs.

```sh
brew install git ripgrep coreutils fd
```

I am on MacOS so I have to install the XCode developer tools

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

Some people have ran into issues directly installing emacs from brew ([Youtube explanation link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg61ocfxk3c)) so we are going to use install it a slightly different way:

```sh
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus
```

Now we need to actually install doom emacs. This is down through cloneing the git repo into your `~/.emacs.d` file that installing `emacs-plus` gave you.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
```

After this, we want to run `doom install`. This command can be run from the recently cloned `doom-emacs` project.

```sh
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
```

You will want to add this doom command to your path because any time you update the config, you will need to run `doom refresh` to sync those changes.

```sh
# inside your .zshrc or .bash_profile
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.emacs.d/bin
```

Finally, run `emacs` in your terminal and you should see the doom homepage.

## The Easy Way

[[Doom Emacs]] is the [[Emacs]] configuration that I use. There are flags that you can use to install common dependencies. To install [[Org Roam]], You need to add the `+roam` flag to your org dependency.

So in your `.doom.d/init.el`, find `org` under the `:lang` section and add the `+roam` flag:

```
:lang
(org +roam)
```

This will install `org-roam`, `org-roam-protocol`, and `company-org-roam` (if you have company enabled).

By default, the org roam directory will be your in your `org-directory/roam`. You can override where your `org-roam-directory`. In your `config.el`:

```elisp
(setq org-roam-directory "~/Desktop/03-resources/org-roam")
```

For my [[Ephemeral Scratchings]], I have switched to using `org-roam-dailies` which is just built into org roam. I call `org-roam-dalies-today` to create or get back to my current daily notes. I keep all of my notes here. You can also use [[Org Journal]]. [[Doom Emacs]] has a flag for this as well:

```
:lang
(org +roam +journal)
```

## The Hard Way

This is how I first installed [[Org Roam]]. There is a lot of custom config code that you have to write that [[Doom Emacs]] has already taken care of for you.

<a id="orga972198"></a>

### Adding Org Roam To Your Config

There are 3 main files that define your doom emacs config:

- config.el
- init.el
- packages.el

`doom emacs` comes with many different packages enabled as well as commented out packages that are popular options. Lets take a look, with emacs running, type `spc f p` and then select the `init.el` file. `spc f p` is a short cut to get to your config from anywhere in emacs.

Scroll down to around line 138, you should see `org` on a line. `Org mode` comes with a `+ roam` flag, so it will install all of the dependencies for you. Change that line to look like this:

```lisp
(org +roam)
```

Now, lets head over to our `config.el` file: `spc f p`, then select `config.el`.

This is the file that you configure all of your packages in. You can see that this is where you can set your fonts and a theme if you want to change them [heres a list of available themes](https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes). This is where we will set the directory that we will create our org-roam files in. I have mine in `~/Desktop/03-resources/org-roam`.

```lisp
(setq org-roam-directory "~/Desktop/03-resources/org-roam")
```

You can access all of the Roam commands with `spc n r`. It's nice to bind your own to skip that one character so lets add some custom key mappings.

Next we want to map some custom commands that you will use a lot in org-roam. To do this we will use the `after!` hook doom provides to set some customization up after the `org-roam` package is loaded.

```lisp
    (after! org-roam
        (map! :leader
            :prefix "n"
            :desc "org-roam" "l" #'org-roam
            :desc "org-roam-insert" "i" #'org-roam-insert
            :desc "org-roam-switch-to-buffer" "b" #'org-roam-switch-to-buffer
            :desc "org-roam-find-file" "f" #'org-roam-find-file
            :desc "org-roam-show-graph" "g" #'org-roam-show-graph
            :desc "org-roam-insert" "i" #'org-roam-insert
            :desc "org-roam-capture" "c" #'org-roam-capture))
```

When you are in the `Org` major emacs mode, you will be able to type `spc n` and then any of these letters above to run those functions. For example, you can run `M-x org-roam` instead of `spc n l` to run the specific function.

When you want to create a new page, you can run `spc n i` to insert a new topic page. This process is customizable with org capture templates so you can pre-fill any data you want based on a specific template.

### Add Bidirectional Link Auto Complete

You need `company-org-roam`. You'll need to install the package. Head over to your `packages.el` file: `spc f p` and select `packages.el`. <SideNote idName={1}>If you are using the `(org +roam)` flag in Doom emacs, then you dont need to do this set up, its already done for you.</SideNote>

The maker of org-roam also made this package, we can install it straight from his github:

```lisp
(package! company-org-roam
   :recipe (:host github :repo "jethrokuan/company-org-roam"))
```

Next, head over to your `config.el` and add the configuration:

```lisp
    (require 'company-org-roam)
    (use-package company-org-roam
      :when (featurep! :completion company)
      :after org-roam
      :config
      (set-company-backend! 'org-mode '(company-org-roam company-yasnippet company-dabbrev)))
```

Now you will need to quit your current session, `doom refresh` and open emacs back up to get this to work. When you start typing, if you type the title or alias of an org roam note, a completion dialogue will show up and you can press `enter` to select the completion.

### Fleeting Notes

Roam Research puts you in a note that corresponds with the current day as a jumping off point for your notes. This same functionality can be accomplished with `org journal`.

You can use `use-package` function that doom emacs provides to install `org journal`. `org journal` comes installed in doom emacs, we just need to configure it to and point it to the same directory as your `org roam` files. Open up your config (`spc f p config.el`) and add this `use-package` statement:

```lisp
    (use-package org-journal
      :bind
      ("C-c n j" . org-journal-new-entry)
      :custom
      (org-journal-dir "~/Desktop/03-resources/org-roam/")
      (org-journal-date-prefix "#+TITLE: ")
      (org-journal-file-format "%Y-%m-%d.org")
      (org-journal-date-format "%A, %d %B %Y"))
    (setq org-journal-enable-agenda-integration t)
```

Now you can enter a new journal for that day with `C-c n j` (`C` is the &ldquo;control&rdquo; key). You can see that we have configured what directory this journal entry is added to (in my case `~/Desktop/03-resources/org-roam/`). I like my Journal titles to be in &ldquo;Tuesday, 05 May 2020&rdquo; format.

I create a lot of `TODO=s to my journal entries so =(setq org-journal-enable-agenda-integration t)` will automatically add these files to my agenda.

<a id="org8942a5c"></a>

### Capture Links From the Web

I&rsquo;ve added a Chrome bookmarklet titled &ldquo;open in roam&rdquo; that will add any webpage I am on as a note in my Roam. [Here are the docs](https://orgroam.com/manual/Roam-Protocol.html#Roam-Protocol) on what an `org-protocol` is and how to set it up with `org-roam`. Make sure to follow the instructions for `Mac OS` installing `platypus`.

I ran the command in the &ldquo;Note for emacs mac port&rdquo; section which totally broke `org-protocol` for me so don&rsquo;t do that ;)

If you are using the `(org +roam)` flag, you wont need to add `(require 'org-roam-protocol)` to your `org-roam` config.

Add a `org-roam-capture-ref-templates` in your `config.el` heres mine:

```lisp
    (after! org-roam
      (setq org-roam-capture-ref-templates
            '(("r" "ref" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
               "%?"
               :file-name "websites/${slug}"
               :head "#+TITLE: ${title}
    #+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}
    - source :: ${ref}"
               :unnarrowed t))))
```

The `ROAM_KEY` is how `org-roam` knows what site links to what note.

Now add the Chrome Bookmarklet. This is just adding a new bookmark. The title for mine is &ldquo;Open Roam Notes&rdquo; and the &ldquo;url&rdquo; is:

```js
javascript: (function () {
  location.href =
    'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref=' +
    encodeURIComponent(location.href) +
    '&title=' +
    encodeURIComponent(document.title)
})()
```

Now when you click the button, it will open or start the capture process for that specific `ROAM_KEY`.

### Navigate your files easily

I was recommended using `deft` to navigate my `org roam` files. This can be done by using the `deft` flag in your `init.el` (this option is disabled by default).

Or you can install it manually:

This can be done by adding `use-package` in your `config.el`.

```lisp
    (use-package deft
      :after org
      :bind
      ("C-c n d" . deft)
      :custom
      (deft-recursive t)
      (deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
      (deft-default-extension "org")
      (deft-directory "~/Desktop/03-resources/org-roam/"))
```

The important part is setting the directory to your `org-roam` directory. Now you can get a list of your most recently edited `org-roam` files.
