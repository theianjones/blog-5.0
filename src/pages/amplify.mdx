# Amplify

## Change The Node Version on amplify

The default build image (`Amazon Linux:2`) that ships with `amplify` has `nvm` installed to change your node version during your build.

If you dont have an `amplify.yml` file, you can download a started from the "Build settings" tab in your aws amplify console.

Inside of you `amplify.yml` you can add commands to run before your build:

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - nvm install 14
        - nvm use 14
        - yarn install
    build:
      commands:
        - yarn run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

Now you should be ready to rock and roll on your build.

## Add public environment variables to a .env

The first step is to add environment variables to via the "Environment variables" tab in the aws amplify console.

Now any variable created there can be referenced by `$YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME` in your `amplify.yml`.

We can add these variables by running some bash lines to echo them into a `.env` file.

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_URL" >> .env
        - nvm install 14
        - nvm use 14
        - yarn install
    build:
      commands:
        - yarn run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

Inside of this Next.js app, I can use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_URL` to access the value.

## Install private npm modules on a github registry

Much like above, you need to add your auth token to your aws environment variables then add these lines to your `amplify.yml` file.

```yaml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_URL" >> .env
        - nvm install 14
        - nvm use 14
        - echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}" > .npmrc
        - echo "@crossfit:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com" >> .npmrc
        - yarn install
    build:
      commands:
        - yarn run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```
