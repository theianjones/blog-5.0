# Yarn Link with Vite

When you are developing an npm module, you dont want to have to publish your changes every time you need to test it.

If you have an application you are using to develop your module in, you can use `yarn link` in the module directory. This tells yarn that other projects on your computer can link to this local version.

Inside of your project, you can run `yarn link moduleName` and it will start using the local version.

With Vite however, this doesnt work out of the box. It seems that Vite caches dependencies in its `node_modules/.vite` folder. You need to remove this folder and restart your dev server to get the link to work.

```
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
yarn vite
```
